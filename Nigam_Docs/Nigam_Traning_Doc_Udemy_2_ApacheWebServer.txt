Apache Web Server - Secure

To check openssl
	rpm -q openssl

To Check mod_ssl
	cd etc/httpd/modules/
	ls -lrt | grep -i mod_ssl

To install mod_ssl
	yum install mod_ssl

The main configuration file for Secure Apache WebServer is 
	/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf 

Digitally Signing the Server 
	1. Creating the public key
	2. Provide the pubic key to reputable CA 
	3. CA will provide a certificate for your publec Key 
	4. You have to put that certificate to your "ssl" derectory key 

To enable SSL Connection update below in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
	Listen 443 https
	LodModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so 

HTTPS/SSL : Adding VirtualHost
	<VirtualHost *:443>
	or
	<VirtualHost SERVER-IP:443> // Does not support Host name

HTTPS/SSL : DocumentRoot
	Specify the Directory where all your webpages should be there
	Recomended to have different root for secure and non-secure
	Default location is - /var/www/html 

HTTPS/SSL : ServerName 
	ServerName is name of your website. 
	Ex: www.yourserver.com:443 

HTTPS/SSL : Create Server Keys
	openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096
	where:
		out: to specofy output file (server.key)
		4096: Length of your Key
	After kay got created it will ask for the password to use. 

HTTPS/SSL : Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
	Must ask our CA (e.g. Equifax, verisign, etc) to sign our certificate 
	You might receive server.csr or/and signed kays from CA 

HTTPS/SSL : To verify your server public key (server.key)
	openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key 

HTTPS/SSL : To Specify the Location of the Certificates  (ssl.comf)
	We need to specify the name and location of our certificate in ssl.conf file
	default ssl.conf location is /etc/pki/tls/certs - for RHEL 7

		SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt 
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/server.key 

		In /etc/httpd/conf.d 
		CA (Certificate Autority) 
			directory location of the CA certificate 
			SSLCACertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/myca.crt 

	cp server.key /etc/pki/tls/private/server.key
	cp server.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt 
	cp myca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/myca.crt 
	Restart the Apache web Server to take effect
